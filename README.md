Tutorial Project: pzcmdr
========================

The project name "pzcmdr" comes from "Pi Zero Commander".
The project was initiated as a controlling device for waking up and shutting
down all the PCs in our computer room by RFID cards. It has been evolved to
include a serial camera and an LED for additional featues. We think the development result
can be easily adapted and extended to similar configurations.

The development process is protyping-based. Therefore, the architecture is improved for each
version of prototype. Therefore, this project is released as a tutorial. There are documents describing
the development concerns and techniques for each prototype. You may learn some Python3 techniques,
Raspberry Pi related setup, and peripherals control from the tutorials. Enjoy!
